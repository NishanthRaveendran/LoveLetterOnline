### The popular card game, but online. 

Love Letter is one of my favourite card games to play with my friends. So I thought it would be really convenient if I just created an online version instead of carrying my cards everywhere. My goal behind this project is to keep a simple, intuitive UI and replicate the experience I have playing with my friends.

## Progress

I am learning as I go, and I will update this project when I feel comfortable with what I've learned.

My goals for this project:

1. Create an elegant user interface
2. Integrate backend for player lobby
3. Add game mechanics and player communication
4. Allow players to create lobbys
5. Stylize game interface

This project will take a while to complete but this is something I am passionate about so I am confident that I will get this done eventually.
