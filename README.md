### The popular card game, but online. 

Love Letter is one of my favourite card games to play with my friends. So I thought it would be really convenient if I just created an online version instead of carrying my cards everywhere. My goal behind this project is to keep a simple, intuitive UI and replicate the experience I have playing with my friends.

## Progress

I am learning as I go, and I will update this project when I feel comfortable with what I've learned.

My goals for this project:

1. Create an elegant user interface
2. Integrate backend for player lobby
3. Add game mechanics and player communication
4. Allow players to create lobbys
5. Stylize game interface
