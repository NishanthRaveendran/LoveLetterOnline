### The popular card game, but online. 

Love Letter is one of my favourite card games to play with my friends. So I thought it would be really convenient if I just created an online version instead of carrying my cards everywhere. My goal behind this project is to keep a simple, intuitive UI and replicate the experience I have playing with my friends.

## Progress

I am learning as I go, and I will update this project when I feel comfortable with what I've learned.

My goals for this project:

- [x] Create an elegant user interface
- [ ] Integrate backend for player lobby
- [ ] Add game mechanics and player communication
- [ ] Allow players to create lobbys
- [ ] Stylize game interface

This project will take a while to complete but this is something I am passionate about so I am confident that I will get this done eventually.
